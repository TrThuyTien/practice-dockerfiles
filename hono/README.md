# Hono Application Dockerfile Example

## Description

This repository provides a Dockerfile example for containerizing a Hono application. Hono is a web framework for the Edges (Cloudflare, Fastly, ...).

## Getting Started

1. Copy the `Dockerfile` and files used in the Dockerfile in your application
2. Build the Docker image by running the following command:

```bash
docker build -t image-name .
```

3. Once the image is built successfully, you can run a container using the following command:

```bash
docker run image-name
```

If the container needs specifying port and volumes if the container needed it.

4. Test your application container

## Customization

You can customize the Dockerfile example to fit your specific application needs. Here are a few areas you might consider modifying:

- **Dependencies**: If your application requires additional dependencies, you can use the RUN command in the Dockerfile to install them. Make sure to update the appropriate package manager command based on your application setup.
- **Environment Variables**: If your application requires environment variables, you can pass them to the container using the -e flag when running the docker run command.
- **Volumes**: If your application needs to access files or directories outside the container, you can use volume mounts to provide access. Update the VOLUME instruction in the Dockerfile and use the -v flag when running the docker run command.
